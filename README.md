This is ns-3-allinone.

If you have downloaded this in tarball release format, this directory
contains some released ns-3 version, along with 3rd party components
necessary to support two optional ns-3 features: Python
bindings and the NetAnim network animator.  In this case, just run the
script build.py; all the components, plus ns-3 itself, will thus be
built.  If you want to build ns-3 examples and tests (a full ns-3 build),
instead type:
./build.py --enable-examples --enable-tests

This directory also contains the bake build tool, which allows access to
other extensions of ns-3, including the Direct Code Execution environment,
and click and openflow extensions for ns-3.  Consult the documentation
on how to use bake to access optional ns-3 components.

If you have downloaded this from Git, the download.py script can be used to
download bake, netanim, pybindgen, and ns-3-dev.  The usage to use
basic ns-3 (netanim and ns-3-dev) is to type:
./download.py
./build.py --enable-examples --enable-tests
and cd into ns-3-dev for further work.
